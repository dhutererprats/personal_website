This is my very own personal professional website that I developed on my own using the following tutorials:

## Resources I used

- portfolio site building from udemy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bMdjkfvONE&list=PLq0PJh6C4j7Jfmjt9XDy7ilEwlIL62RxR&index=1

- adding social icons from a random youtuber: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecvmB0HH5MM&t=494s

- and of course, chatgpt for syntax help: https://chat.openai.com/

## Usage Note

Please feel free to use this as a template to build your own site if you really like the format etc.
